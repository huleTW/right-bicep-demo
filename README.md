## Graph
### 可视化类之间的关系
*input* [[1,2,3], [3,5,6],[3,4,6,20],[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,55],[3,4,68,9,10,42,53,57],[4,29,49,10,9,19,0,30]]

*output* links,nodes

将output转成json后，上传到https://observablehq.com/@huletw/force-directed-graph
靠的越近的类，一起出现的概率越高，可以进行聚类

## 测试各种原则demo

### Right-BICEP 
*Right* – are the results right?

*B* – are all the boundary conditions CORRECT?

*I* – can you check inverse relationships?

*C* – can you cross-check results using other means?

*E* – can you force error conditions to happen?

*P* – are performance characteristics within bounds?

### CORRECT
*Conformance* – Does the value conform to an expected format?

*Ordering* – is the set of values ordered or unordered as appropriate?

*Range* – is the value within reasonable minimum and maximum values?

*Reference* – does the code reference anything external that isn’t under direct control of the code itself?Existence – Does the value exist?

*Cardinality* – are there exactly enough values?

*Time* – is everything happening in order? At the right time? In time?
